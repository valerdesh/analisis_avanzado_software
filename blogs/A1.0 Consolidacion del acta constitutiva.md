## :trophy: A1.0 Learning activity
Project's constitutive act elaboration.
 
### :blue_book: Instructions
 
* Based on the provided information by the teacher about design's thinking empathize phase, develop the indicated activity from the development's section, and if necessary make a brief investigation about **tools to collect information for the customer requirements analysis**.
 
* Every activity or challenge must be realized using **Markdown style with .md extension** and VSCode development environment, it has to be as a **single page** document, which means if the document has images, links or another external document it must be accessed from tags and links, and must be named with the nomenclature **A0.1_ActivityName_StudentName.pdf**.
 
* As a requirement the .MD file must contain a tag of the link to the repository of your GITHUB document, for example a **Link to my GitHub** and after finishing the task it must be submitted to Github.
 
* From the **.md** file export a **.pdf** that must be uploaded to Classroom in the corresponding section, serving as evidence of turned in, since being the **official** platform here you will receive the activity's result.
Considering that the .PDF file was obtained from the .MD file, both must be identical.
 
* Your repository, besides containing a **readme**.md inside the root directory containing student's information, team, subject, career, teacher's information, and also a logo or pictures, must contain a section of contents or index, which are **links to your md documents**, try not to use text to indicate internal or external links.
 
* It's suggested to use a structure similar to the one indicated below, however, you can use any other structure that can help you organize your repository.

##Conclusions
##### **1. Arredondo Bonilla Cesar**
In this practice in my case I had some problems when trying to fill in some points of the constitutive act, such as when trying to establish the cost of the software, to solve that problem I had to investigate different methodologies to calculate the cost of a software and the one that It seemed simpler was the estimation based on the use case points method, with this you can obtain the man-hours required to develop a software and with these obtain the final cost.
In addition to this, it was possible to have a clearer vision of the different important points to consider during the development of the software.
 
 
 
##### **2. Chavez Vargas Javier**
In this practice of the constitutive act, you learn how to fill out a document with the bases of a project where the greatest amount of information that represents the project is written, so when someone reads it, they are able to understand the right and know who is part of the project. The fields to fill in are common information but you have to think well about what to write, and detail the fields well to be more explicit and that anyone can understand them, although it does not hurt to be guided by other articles of incorporation to guide you and have a better perspective from work. With this act, those in charge of receiving it can better understand the project
 
##### **3. Mancilla Mora Moises **
In this practice, the important points of the constitutive act of the project were developed, the justification was established for why this project is going to be elaborated and a brief description of what the project consists of. It was analyzed, what is sought with this project and the expected results. During the development of the high-level requirements, it was being developed thinking about the requirements that were obtained from the interview. We also thought about all the key moments during the development of the project and the possible risks that the project can affect during its development and in the final delivery. With the points made, you can have a better idea about the project.
 
 
 
##### **4.Valerde Sanchez Alejandro **
The previous practice was a representation of how the constitution of a company in full development is established. As could be seen, creating this document requires a lot of planning and a detailed analysis of the tasks to be carried out. The purpose to comply with the minutes is achieved by establishing the points, members, objectives, purposes and stakeholders involved. The practice was concluded individually and then completed as a team, each one contributing a part to the final work.
