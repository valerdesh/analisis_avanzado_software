 # Introduction

## :trophy: A0.1 Learning activity

### Objective

Elaborate the context of the case study, as well as a field interview, and finally consolidate the information of the requirements, using the empathize phase proposed by design thinking

* * *

## :pencil2: Development

Taking as a basis the characteristics referred to in the case study and the design thinking proposal, elaborate context, a list of at least 15 questions directed to the client, such that they can give you more detailed information to elaborate the analysis of the requirements on the case study.
Once the interview indicated in the previous point has been done, use any of the techniques that are proposed within the empathize phase of design thinking, and you can even use any other tool, technique or artifact to consolidate the information collected through the client and elaborate your proposal of the business model of the system to be developed.
Prepare and expose your document, considering doing the dynamics as you would do a job in the field or client site, and present it to the advisor and your classmates.

### :package: Consolidate the information: Value Proposition Canvas

![Value Proposition Canvas][2]

### :busts_in_silhouette: Conclusions

>Arredondo Bonilla Cesar:
With this practice, it was possible to know how the process of obtaining data is needed for the elaboration of the requirements of the software to be developed, to do this design thinking was used, which suggests that an interview should be realized with the potential client, 15 questions were asked which were ordered and elaborated based on the characteristics raised in case study 2. The process of elaborating these was a bit difficult since it was necessary to think about how to decompose each characteristic into more specific things, such as the presentation of information, kinds of users, colors, how to present the analytics or what kind of files are allowed. When observing the interviews of other teams, it was possible to observe that the questions had small details that had to be corrected since, like them, we had questions in which we had to better explain what we were referring to, added information for better understanding; In addition, from these interviews, some questions from my team were resolved. Once the interview was realized, the information we were looking for was obtained and the answers were reconsidered in the form of characteristics of the software. Finally, the process of consolidating the information was be done, in which it was not very clear which technique was the most appropriate, but after reviewing each one it was concluded to use the Value Proposition Canvas, since in this points of the client as well as the software or the product is being considered, it also allowed us to capture the characteristics of both the results of the interview and the information available from the case study. Also during the development of this, three tools were found that are similar to this case study, such as GitHub, Bitrix24 and AnswerHub.          

>Chavez Vargas Javier:
This practice is mainly about knowing customers, we must be able to understand what they need and want in a software that is based (in our case in case study 2), for this, it was necessary to conduct an interview in English , which, the fact that it is in English is not the problem, but how to ask the questions that should be asked to the client, which caused them to think better how to ask these questions, since based on some characteristics previously obtained, and from them we had to ask more questions to obtain more information, so these questions should be asked carefully so as not to force the client to tell you what we want, if not what they need and would like to see in certain characteristics. From the interview, a large amount of important data is obtained that must be analyzed, and based on this, the requirements for the product to be of general use must be obtained. Interviews in my opinion should be done with a certain amount of potential clients and get an average of responses and get the requirements out of those results. Once the responses have been analyzed, the specific requirements that we consider necessary for the platform are drawn. In addition, for the practice, it was necessary to consolidate the information using design thinking, which was a new experience since I had never heard of this topic until the classes that were taken previously, from this topic the tools to consolidate the information were taken, from which We select the value proposition canvas, since it allows us to explain in a better way what requirements the client and the application need based on the requirements that were obtained, to translate each component on the canvas we have to think a little more about how and where to place each component for the canvas to make sense, but with a bit of parsing and time they are properly placed.

>Mancilla Mora Moises:
During the course of the practice it was possible to understand the different processes that are elaborated during the beginning of a software project. Before starting a project, you must first be clear about what is going to be carried out, for that you must take into consideration what the client needs, for that a questionnaire in English was made to the client taking in mind the possible needs and covering the points seen from the case study 2. Once the interview was done, it was possible to have a clearer idea, what the main requirements of the client for the project are going to do. A list of requirements was drawn up based on the answers from the interview and it is clearer the characteristics that the platform that will be developed will have, such as design, colors, also understanding how users are managed within the platform, which is what they are allowed to do and their limitations. Once the requirements have been analyzed, we gather this information, using a design thinking tool to visualize different points of the project. There were doubts at the time of elaborating the model since we did not know which models were the most appropriate for the project, but when analyzing the models we determined to use the Value Proposition Canvas, since we can enter characteristics of both the client and the project.

>Valerde Sanchez Alejandro:
This practice touches a crucial point in any software development process, which is the collection of information and how the relationship with a client is treated. Before starting with the construction of a project, there is a series of documentation that is necessary to gather to establish a step to follow. The practice used the use of design thinking, which aims to have design thinking when identifying, analyzing and looking for a solution to a problem. Another important competence to develop in the course of this activity was to function in English by translating all the information collected during the preparation.
For the purpose of collecting information regarding the case study, a consumer of similar software was interviewed to find out what requirements a platform is needed for this case study. Several important points of the platform as well as the client are highlighted, such as: needs, desires and fears. In the product, points such as benefits, the experience they provide to the user and the characteristics that it has are analyzed. To represent what was obtained from the questions, we opted to choose the Canvas value proposition and this model allows us to accurately represent the customer and product points.
